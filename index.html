            <p> In Web Development we focused our attention on our Chat Bot we are creating. Our Chat Bot has AI intelligence via API, or Application Programming Interface. Meaning that two different platforms are integrating their capabillites.  </p>
            <p> Last week, we used Postman to test our API calls or requests. Then we used to it fetch weather data into our weather app.</p>
        <h2 class="mt-4 bg-info rounded-5 text-center">This Week</h2>
            <p> This week we utilized Hugging Man to fetch answers from a live AI Model (text to text); The user can type whatever question they can think of while our chosed AI model gives the user a response.</p>
            <p> Robert suggested we utilize a pre tag so that our text in our Output-Display will wrap.</p>

            <p> I also learned that the API key is a private key that should not be shared with anyone. It is used to authenticate requests associated with your project for usage and billing purposes. </p>
            <p> Adding Bootstrap to my webpage is one of the best things I enjoy about creating my html page.</p>

            <p>This week my blocker was my home life and prioritizing balance in all aspects of my life.</p>
            <p> I am grateful for the support of my family and friends as I navigate this journey of learning web development. </p>
            <p> It has been into my awareness how important this class has become for me. </p>

        <h3 class="mt-4 bg-info rounded-5 text-center">Next Steps</h3>
            <p> Next week I will be adding more functionality to my Chat Bot. There are so many possiblities. I am excited to see where this project takes me.</p>
